Likewise, for each word we could check if every word on its left is lexicographically smaller. That said, we don't need to compare every word to all of the words to its right. Instead, we can just compare each pair of adjacent words. If all pairs of adjacent words are sorted, then we can safely conclude that words is sorted. Furthermore, if any pair of adjacent words is not sorted, then we know that words is not sorted."
